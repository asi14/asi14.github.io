          <p> I have replaced many sensitive words with the word <b>[CENSORED]</b> so that any unnecessary information need not be revealed to the general public. I am a privacy-concious individual.</p>
          <p>I was born in <b>[CENSORED]</b> on <b>[CENSORED]</b>. Shortly afterwards, my parents whisked me up to the <b>[CENSORED]</b>, where I would spend a substantial portion of my childhood. I vaguely remember a few moments of that time in the <b>[CENSORED</b>, such as a train ride on what appeared to be an <a href = "https://goo.gl/AtYGEu" class = "linelink" target = "_blank">R142</a> on the... <b>[CENSORED]</b> Train? (No surprises there) I also remember living in what appears to be a suburban part of the <b>[CENSORED]</b>, if there was ever such as thing as a *safe* suburban section of the <b>[CENSORED]</b>.</p>
          <p>I next remember moving back to <b>[CENSORED]</b> (perhaps because of the <b>[CENSORED]</b>'s reputation on "safety"), where I am still living today. The first place I remember living in <b>[CENSORED]</b> is in another suburban area called <b>[CENSORED]</b>. It was many times safer the <b>[CENSORED]</b>, and also many times quieter. I vaguely thought <b>[CENSORED]</b> was near Astoria for some reason, which now that I think about it is preposterous.</p>
          <!--Imbed google map-->
          <p>I next moved to the <b>[CENSORED]</b> Region, where I generally live to this day. It's conveniently next to the <a href = "https://goo.gl/gMmLQH" class = "linelink" target = "_blank">Long Island Railroad</a> (LIRR), at the <b>[CENSORED]</b> Station, on the <b>[CENSORED]</b> Branch. I used to live closer to the Railroad, but I moved again within the region to be closer to my elementary school, <b>[CENSORED]</b>. I never did find myself quite amongst friends, but I didn't find this strange because I was a newcomer. Interestingly, <b>[CENSORED]</b> <b>[CENSORED]</b> <b>[CENSORED]</b> <b>[CENSORED]</b> <b>[CENSORED]</b> <b>[CENSORED]</b> <b>[CENSORED]</b> <b>[CENSORED]</b> <b>[CENSORED]</b> <b>[CENSORED]</b> <b>[CENSORED]</b> <b>[CENSORED]</b>.</p>
          <p>I presently go to to <b>[CENSORED]</b> for high school, back in the <b>[CENSORED]</b>. <b>[CENSORED]</b> is an interesting school, at best. We have many blazers at <b>[CENSORED]</b>, but we also have lots of smart people. I wouldn't say we are particularly smart, but we do have our brightest lightbulbs, and then some. If there's one thing I wish this school would improve on, I just wish that the school lunch food would get better. That's a small request coming from many other needs, but someone please just make the food taste like actual food.</p>

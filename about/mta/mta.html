        <h1>A Q & A about New York City's Railfans</h1>

        <p style = "font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 50%;">Credit: Gothamist</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class = "body_container">
          <p>As many know, I am a passionate railfan of the New York City Subway. I've been asked many questions about my tradesmanship, so I (representing the NYC railfan community) will answer major questions here*.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>What started you to being a railfan?</b></li>
              <img src = "idk.gif" class = "img">
            <li><b>What's your favorite line of the subway, and why? Also what's your favorite train model and why?</b></li>
              <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_(New_York_City_Subway_service)"><img src = "favtrain.png" class = "img"></a>
              <p>One popular nickname for the 7 Train is the "International Express", and is why the 7's my favorite. It travels through a wide variety of neighbourhoods of many ethnicities, and reflects the lives of the riders it serves. Not to get philosophical or anything (I have a page for that)</p>
                <p>Also because it's home to the R188 subway car, and it's beautiful. Guess that answers the question of what train model I like.</p>
                <a href = "https://goo.gl/1U3ggF"><img src = "r188.jpg" class = "img"></a>
            <li><b>Do you like trains?</b></li>
              <div class = "youtube"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hHkKJfcBXcw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
            <li><b>What do you think the MTA should improve on?</b></li>
              <p>There are many problems I could point out, but the biggest problem with the MTA (in my opinion) is its infastructure (I and a team actually wrote about this in a <a href = "termpaper.pdf" class = "linelink" target = "_blank">term paper</a>). In short, the system (in this case, fixed-block signalling) is antiquated and needs a facelift; this is where <a href = "https://goo.gl/cWSSLN" class = "linelink" target = "_blank">Communications-Based Train Control</a> (CBTC) comes in.</p>
              <!--insert image of shitty service-->
              <p>But an underlying problem is the MTA's approach to its problems. Its administration doesn't appear to care much for its riders' convenience, which is problematic because a) this <a href = "http://goo.gl/vtUUmo" class = "linelink" target = "_blank">skwers MTA-rider relations</a>, and b) leads to <a href = "http://goo.gl/QbWfiE" class = "linelink" target = "_blank">further problems with service</a>.</p>
              <p>This issue won't be resolved by any simple fix- it requires a change of mind, something that requires cooperation and understanding on both sides.</p>
            <li><b>Subways aren't known for being the safest places. Have you ever been in a dangerous subway situation?</b></li>
              <p>I don't think I've ever been in any particularly <b style = "color: red">dangerous</b> situations on the subway, but I have seen plenty of peculiar, odd things occur on the subway.</p>
              <p>For instance, I recall this one time where I was on the D Train going up on the express line next to Central Park, where these performers began dancing to some song.</p>
              <p>And then this tourist goes up and shuts off their music player. This is where the fun begins, because the performers go up and are about to start brawling, when the conductor comes out and smooth-talks everyone, defusing the situation.</p>
              <p>After that day, I gained a newfound respect for train conductors.</p>
          </ol>
          <p style = "font-size: 0.7em;">*Thanks Ilana for giving me inspriation for these questions <3!</p>

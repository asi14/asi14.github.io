          <h2>The Big Picture</h2>
            <small>Click <a href = "#tldr1.1">Here</a> for a TL;DR description of objects and classes.</small>
            <p>In Java, an <b>object</b> is literally what it says it is: an <em>object</em>. Objects have certain <b>attributes</b> which outline <em>basic details</em> about the object. Objects can also have <b>methods</b> by which objects can <em> do things</em>.</p>
            <p>To illustrate this, take for example a simple object, like a tape dispenser.</p>
            <img  class = "img-responsive" src = "img/tapedispenser.jpg" style = "margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;">
            <div style = "text-align: center;"><small>Figure 1: A Tape Dispenser</small></div>
            <p>The tape dispenser has several <em>basic details</em> about it, such as the <b>amount of tape</b> it has, and can <em> do things</em>, like <b>dispense tape.</b></p>
            <div style = "text-align: center;">
              <div class = "row">
                <div class = "col-md-12" style = "text-align: center;"><small>Figure 2: Methods and Attributes</small></div>

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>This tape dispenser is only one kind of tape dispenser out of many- the <em>idea</em> of the tape dispenser illustrates what a <b>class</b> is, a <em>blueprint for the tape dispenser.</em></p>

          <h2>Data Conversion</h2>
            <p>Using primative types inevitably requires conversions between them- there are two kinds of conversions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Widening Conversions</b>: Conversions that convert into a primative type of <em> same or higher</em> complexity. Example: <code>int</code> to <code>double</code> (integer -> decimal).<br><div class = "alert alert-success"><b>Note</b>: These are the best conversions because you won't lose any information in the process.</div></li>
              <li><b>Narrowing Conversions</b>: Conversions that convert into a primative type of <em>lower</em> complexity. Example: <code>double</code> to <code>int</code> (decimal -> integer).<br><div class = "alert alert-danger"><b>Careful!</b> You'll lose information about your values if you use this type of conversion!</div></li>
              <li><code>boolean</code> doesn't apply here because it can't be converted to another primative type.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <pre class = "prettyprint">
public class Conversions{
  public static void assignConvert(){
    double money;
    int dollars = 5;
    money = dollars; //dollar's int value gets turned into money's double value
                     //also an example of Widening Conversions
  }
  public static void arithmeticPromotion(){
    double sum = 5.6;
    int count = 3;
    double reuslt = sum / count; //count's int value is converted into double (float) since sum and reuslt is double
                                 //Note how sum is a float, so the output is a float either way
  }
  public static void casting(){
    int dollars;
    double money = 5.6;
    dollars = (int) money; //the desired type of conversion is put next to the var being converted
                           //also an example of Narrowing Conversions, as the decimal part of money gets chopped off
                           //has useful applications in rounding
  }
}
            </pre>
          <h2>Enumerated Types</h2>
            <p><code>enum</code> is a way to <b>make your own</b>'primative' types.</p>

    specialized = School.Bxsci;
    School trash = School.Stuy;

            <p><small>reminds you about GridWorld, eh? ;)</small></p>
            <p><b>Class Libraries</b> support program development- by a lot. Example: <code>Scanner</code> and <code>String</code> are both Class Libraries. They're <em>not</em> part of the Java Language, but they're part of the <em>Standard Class Library</em>, and also <b>APIs</b> (Application Programmer Interface). They're grouped into <b>packages</b>, so programmers group classes easily. Example: <code>System</code> is part of <code>java.lang</code>.</p>
            <p>Asides from <code>java.lang</code> you have to <b>import</b> other classes, like so: <code> import java.util.*</code>. Here's a useful class of <code>java.util</code>: <code>Random</code></p>
            <pre class = "prettyprint">

            <p>Another good class to know: <code>java.lang.Math</code>.</p>
          <h2>User Input</h2>
            <p><code>Scanner</code> is your answer.</p>
            <pre class = "prettyprint">
import java.util.Scanner; //imports the Scanner class in. MUST HAVE

public class scannerDemo{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner kb = new Scanner(System.in); //creates a Scanner object with the Scanner constructor.
    //System.in tells Java it's user input.
    System.out.println("Please enter a number");
    int num = kb.nextInt(); //waits for the integer input.
    //you can enter any type depending on its type-- next[insert type]()
    System.out.println("The entry was" + num);
  }
}
            </pre>
            <p>note that if the user inputs the wrong type (e.g. <code>String</code> for an <code>int</code>), the exception <code>Input.Mismatch.Exception</code> appears. You'll learn <b>try and catch loops</b> that take care of that later.</p>
          <h2>Applets</h2>
            <p><b>Applets</b>: java programs designed for the web. The biggest difference is that applets don't have a <code>main</code> method, and <code> java.applet.Applet</code> is required. It's something you should just know, but more important is <code>Graphics</code>.</p>
            <h3>Graphics</h3>
              <p><code>Graphics</code> is a very useful class for... graphics, that is part of <code>java.awt</code>, a package.</p>
              <p>Using <code>Graphics</code> is pretty self-explanatory, with one key difference: <b>Graphics objects aren't instantiated like normal objects</b>. Rather it's what's called<em>graphics context</em></p>

  public void nextPage(){
    if(currentPages < numPages){
      currentPages+=1;

}
            </pre>
            <h3>Instance Data</h3>
              <p>Where a variable is <em>declared</em> determines its <b>scope</b>-- where it can be used. Here, take a look.</p>
              <pre class = "prettyprint">
public class scopeEx{
  //these fields have a scope that spans the ENTIRE CLASS, because they're declared outside all methods.
  //that's the nifty thing about fields, actually because you can toss them around basicaly.
  private int field1;
  private String field2;
  public void method1{
    int variable1 = 4; //this variable has a scope of the entire method, and can be used by all program/control flows.
    while(variable1 != 10){
      variable1+=1;
      int count = variable1; //this variable has a scope of only inside the while loop, and can't be used outside.
    }
    System.out.println(count); //this gives an error because count is in the scope of the while loop.
  }
}
              </pre>
              <p>Actually, <code>scopeEx</code> illustrates what <b>encapsulation</b> is pretty well. It hides its internal variables (the fields <code>field1</code> and <code>field2</code> from other classes), and does so using the <em>modifier</em> <code>private</code>. There's two other modifiers: <code>public</code> and <code>final</code> (variable value can't be changed any further).</p>

            </pre>
            <p>Also important is <code>return</code>- it serves two roles in Java. If a method's return type is set to a partiular type (see <code>int</code> in <code>getCurrentPages()</code>), <code>return</code> allows you to return a variable/value <em>of that type</em>. (If you tried returning a string you're getting an error) But if the return type is set to <code>void</code> (see <code>nextPage()</code>), then <code>return</code> <em>exits the program flow out of the method into the next higher-up method.</em>(<code>return</code> has no val/variable next to it cause it's <code>void</code>, otherwise an error gets triggered)</p>
            <p>For example, if <code>nextPage()</code> had a <code>return</code> keyword, it would send the control flow up towards the <code>main(String[] args)</code> method since it <em>called</em> <code>nextPage()</code>.</p>
            <h3>Parameters</h3>
              <pre class = "prettyprint">

          <h2>Method Overloading</h2>
            <p><b>Method Overloading</b>: multiple methods of thes same name. They're very useful for setting mutliple construtors for the same class.</p>
            <pre class = "prettyprint">

            <h3>Method Decomposition</h3>
              <p>If a method becomes too complicated and windy, you can <em>break it up into smaller methods</em> to make the entire thing easier to operate.</p>
          <h2>Obect Relationships</h2>
            <p><b>Use Relationships</b>: classes 'aware' of each other and can use each other. This can apply to objects of different classes, or <em>the same class</em>.</p>

            </pre>
            <p><b>Aggregation</b> is often called a <em>has-a</em> relationship, and basically is an object with other objects as fields.</p>

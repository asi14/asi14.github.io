          </div>
          <h2>The Big Picture</h2>
            <small>Click <a href = "#tldr1.1">Here</a> for a TL;DR description of objects and classes.</small>
            <p>In Java, an <b>object</b> is literally what it says it is: an <em>object</em>. Objects have certain <b>attributes</b> which outline <em>basic details</em> about the object. Objects can also have <b>methods</b> by which objects can <em> do things</em>.</p>
            <p>To illustrate this, take for example a simple object, like a tape dispenser.</p>
            <img  class = "img-responsive" src = "img/tapedispenser.jpg" style = "margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;">
            <div style = "text-align: center;"><small>Figure 1: A Tape Dispenser</small></div>
            <p>The tape dispenser has several <em>basic details</em> about it, such as the <b>amount of tape</b> it has, and can <em> do things</em>, like <b>dispense tape.</b></p>
            <div style = "text-align: center;">

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>This tape dispenser is only one kind of tape dispenser out of many- the <em>idea</em> of the tape dispenser illustrates what a <b>class</b> is.</p>

            <p><b>NOTE:</b> Strings are very useful, but aren't primative data types- they are strings.</p>

          <h2>Data Conversion</h2>
            <p>Using primative types inevitably requires conversions between them- there are two kinds of conversions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Widening Conversions</b>: Conversions that convert into a primative type of <em> same or higher</em> complexity. Example: <code>int</code> to <code>double</code> (integer -> decimal).<br><div class = "alert alert-success"><b>Note</b>: These are the best conversions because you won't lose any information in the process.</div></li>
              <li><b>Narrowing Conversions</b>: Conversions that convert into a primative type of <em>lower</em> complexity. Example: <code>double</code> to <code>int</code> (decimal -> integer).<br><div class = "alert alert-danger"><b>Careful!</b> You'll lose information about your values if you use this type of conversion!</div></li>
              <li><code>boolean</code> doesn't apply here because it can't be converted to another primative type.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <pre class = "prettyprint">
public class Conversions{
  public static void assignConvert(){
    double money;
    int dollars = 5;
    money = dollars; //dollar's int value gets turned into money's double value
                     //also an example of Widening Conversions
  }
  public static void arithmeticPromotion(){
    double sum = 5.6;
    int count = 3;
    double reuslt = sum / count; //count's int value is converted into double (float) since sum and reuslt is double
                                 //Note how sum is a float, so the output is a float either way
  }
  public static void casting(){
    int dollars;
    double money = 5.6;
    dollars = (int) money; //the desired type of conversion is put next to the var being converted
                           //also an example of Narrowing Conversions, as the decimal part of money gets chopped off
                           //has useful applications in rounding
  }
}
            </pre>

They're <em>not</em> part of the Java Language, but they're part of the <em>Standard Class Library</em>, and also <b>APIs</b> (Application Programmer Interface). They're grouped into <b>packages</b>, so programmers group classes easily. Example: <code>System</code> is part of <code>java.lang</code>.</p>
            <p>Asides from <code>java.lang</code> you have to <b>import</b> other classes, like so: <code> import java.util.*</code>. Here's a useful class of <code>java.util</code>: <code>Random</code></p>
            <pre class = "prettyprint">
import java.util.Random;

public class RandomStuff{
  public static main(String)[] args{
    Random machine = new Random(); //creates the random object
    int number = machine.nextInt(10); //generates a number from 0 to 9 (a.k.a 10 - 1)
    double float = machine.nextDouble(); //generates a rnumber from 0 to 1.
    int scaled = machine.nextInt(10) + 9000; //you can scale numbers, so this line generates numbers from 9000 to 9009.
  }
}
            </pre>
            <p>Another good class to know: <code>java.lang.Math</code>.</p>
          <h2>User Input</h2>
            <p><code>Scanner</code> is your answer.</p>
            <pre class = "prettyprint">
import java.util.Scanner; //imports the Scanner class in. MUST HAVE

public class scannerDemo{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner kb = new Scanner(System.in); //creates a Scanner object with the Scanner constructor.
    //System.in tells Java it's user input.
    System.out.println("Please enter a number");
    int num = kb.nextInt(); //waits for the integer input.
    //you can enter any type depending on its type-- next[insert type]()
    System.out.println("The entry was" + num);
  }
}
            </pre>
            <p>note that if the user inputs the wrong type (e.g. <code>String</code> for an <code>int</code>), the exception <code>Input.Mismatch.Exception</code> appears. You'll learn <b>try and catch loops</b> that take care of that later.</p>
          <h2>Applets</h2>
            <p><b>Applets</b>: java programs designed for the web. The biggest difference is that applets don't have a <code>main</code> method, and <code> java.applet.Applet</code> is required. It's something you should just know, but more important is <code>Graphics</code>.</p>
            <h3>Graphics</h3>
              <p><code>Graphics</code> is a very useful class for... graphics, that is part of <code>java.awt</code>, a package.</p>
              <p>Using <code>Graphics</code> is pretty self-explanatory, with one key difference: <b>Graphics objects aren't instantiated like normal objects</b>. Rather it's what's called<em>graphics context</em></p>

          <h2>Anatomy of a Class</h2>
            <pre class = "prettyprint">
//syntax: [tag] class [ClassName]
public class BookTest{ //this is the MAIN class because it has the "main function"
  //method syntax: [public/private/protected/none][void/type] methodName([type] parameter name)
  public static void main(String[] args){ //this is the syntax for the MAIN method. (best memorize it)
    Book book1 = new Book(3); //the 'new' operator declares a new object, instantiated from a class.
    //object declaration syntax: [class] varname = new [class](parameters);
    for(int i = 1; i<=3; i++){
      book1.nextPage(); //this calls a method
      System.out.println(book1.getCurrentPages()); //so does this
    }
  }
}

class Book{ //this is a second class in the program.
  //these are FIELDS, or INSTANCE VARIABLES (vocab is the same)
  //note how these are PRIVATE because you're ENCAPSULATING these inside the class.
  private int numPages;
  private int currentPages;
  public Book(int n){//this is called a CONSTRUCTOR, because this sets up the object. more often than not it defines fields.
    //these lines are giving values to the fields, for other classes to use.
    numPages = n;
    currentPages = 1;
  }

  //these next two methods are called ACCESSOR methods, as you're ACCESSING a field and returning it outside a class.
  public int getNumPages(){
    return numPages;
  }
  public int getCurrentPages(){
    return currentPages;
  }


  public void nextPage(){
    if(currentPages < numPages){
      currentPages+=1;
    }
  }
}
            </pre>
            <h3>Instance Data</h3>
              <p>Where a variable is <em>declared</em> determines its <b>scope</b>-- where it can be used. Here, take a look.</p>
              <pre class = "prettyprint">
public class scopeEx{
  //these fields have a scope that spans the ENTIRE CLASS, because they're declared outside all methods.
  //that's the nifty thing about fields, actually because you can toss them around basicaly.
  private int field1;
  private String field2;
  public void method1{
    int variable1 = 4; //this variable has a scope of the entire method, and can be used by all program/control flows.
    while(variable1 != 10){
      variable1+=1;
      int count = variable1; //this variable has a scope of only inside the while loop, and can't be used outside.
    }
    System.out.println(count); //this gives an error because count is in the scope of the while loop.
  }
}
              </pre>
              <p>Actually, <code>scopeEx</code> illustrates what <b>encapsulation</b> is pretty well. It hides its internal variables (the fields <code>field1</code> and <code>field2</code> from other classes), and does so using the <em>modifier</em> <code>private</code>. There's two other modifiers: <code>public</code> and <code>final</code> (variable value can't be changed any further).</p>

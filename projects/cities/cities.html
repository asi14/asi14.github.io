          <p>The city has become the predominant mode of living all throughout the world, both in its urban and in its suburban aspects. Plenty of cities are big and famous, but a select few have emerged to be widely known and visited by tourists from all around the world. This list is a compilation of the best cities have to offer.</p>

            <h2>New York City, New York</h2>
            <p>Of the world's biggest cities, most people think of New York City on the spot. "The City that Never Sleeps", New York is a thriving cultural and economic center that attracts millions of (usually unwanted (by its inhabitants)) tourists every year. New York City has plenty of notable landmarks, such as the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, and Grand Central Terminal, one of the busiest (and most elaborately built) terminals in the world. </p>

            <h2>Boston, Massachussets</h2>
            <p>Boston, Massachussets: one of the oldest cities in America. It played host to a number of key events of the American Revolution (e.g. the Boston Tea Party), and has artifacts from nearly all the United State's major time periods. Today is a major center of education and culture. Its subway, the <b>Massachussetts Bay Transportation Authority</b>, is <em>the</em> oldest country in America, and immediately suceeded an older transit authority called the Metropolitan Transit Authority (Coincidence? I think not!).</p>

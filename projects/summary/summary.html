          <p>After weeks of programming and <a href = "semicolon.jpg" class = "linelink" target = "_blank">playing hide and seek with semicolons</a>, I have nearly completed this project.
          <p>Actually, nevermind. I take that back. I have plenty more to do with this webpage; I'm just finished with the project requirements, and I don't have that much time left. Hence, I'll take this time to reflect on what I've learned, and think about what I can do to further expand this project, as well as nicely summarize what happened in this adventure.</p>
          <h2 style = "background-color: #0039A6;">Intended Look and Feel</h2>
            <p>When I began this project, I found this website called <a href = "http://www.irving-goh.com/" class = "linelink" target = "_blank">www.irving-goh.com</a>, which I used as inspiration. Its lack of extravagence and frugality gave the website a sleak impression that really interested me, and was what I aimed for.<p>
            <p>Well, did I achieve it? Not quite.</p>
            <p>I used two navigation bars (one of which was paired with the "About" page) to serve as a form of navigation, and I used the subway sign as a portal back home. That's it, really. Nothing special. No super-fancy CSS, no finnicky Javacript. If a feature was not absolutely needed (either for website functionality or project requirement), it was removed. As a result, I produced a website that doesn't contain much, and... looks pretty barren.</p>
            <p>I never really intended for this website to be <em>that</em> amazing. I wanted it to be effective. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
          <h2 style = "background-color: #FF6319;">Programming Implementation</h2>
            <img style = "float: right; padding: 0.3em;" src = "div.jpg">
            <p>One important thing I should go over is my CSS structure. I structured it based on <em>what level it was needed most</em>. If parts of the programming was used on all pages (e.g. CSS for the subway sign), I put it in the "omega" stylesheet, stylesheet.css. If this programming were needed particularly for the "About" pages (e.g. the second navbar), I put it under a secondary stylesheet specifically for the "About" pages. called "aboutstyle.css". CSS that applied to a particular page was put in the < style > tag at the head of the page, while insignificant CSS was applied inline.</p>
            <p>My website utilized a LOT of divs pretty much everywhere. They were essential to giving me control over my webpage's design. Now, using too many divs is probably not necessarily a good thing, but I thought it appropriate to maximize control, at least if I wanted to make future major edits.</p>
            <p>But above all, the one question I asked myself while I created the website was "Do I REALLY want/need this feature?" If I had doubts about the feature, I removed it. I wanted every feature in my website to have a definitive purpose, however small it may be. This led me to avoid extravagence wherever possible (e.g. using sans-serif as the standard font instead of something more exotic like Tahoma), simplify features (or drop features altogether if necessary), etc.</p>
            <p>Shoot, I should've used a span once or twice.</p>
          <h2 style = "background-color: #6CBE45;">Knowledge and Accomplishments</h2>
            <p>Did I accomplish a lot? Not in particular. I just got more experience. But one definiive thing I learned was how to best approach programming. By the end of this project, my website won't mean anything. But the wonderful thing about programming is that htere's no such thing as being "finished". There's always more work to be done, something extra you can change. Therefore, it's useless to think of programming as reaching an "end-point", but rather an everlasting adventure, taking people who knows where.</p>
            <p>It's a wonderful thing, programming.</p>
